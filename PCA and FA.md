# Summary of Principal Component Analysis(PCA) and Factor Analysis(FA)
This article mainly summary the differences between principal component analysis and factor analysis, their advantage & disadvantage, and my personal vas examples.

## Differences
- Principal Component Analysis:
  - Can be selected based on their contribution rates to retain the maximun number nevessary, thereby it could summarize, compress, and reduce the dimensionlity of variables.
  - Represents the principal components as linear combinations of the initial variables.
  - Principal Component Analysis is merely a transformation of variables.
- Factor Analysis:
  - Factor Analysis is primarily used to identify which factors determine each variable. It uncovers the underlying causes of each variable, revealing how common factors
    influence them. Eaaentially, it serves as an expansion and interpretation of the variables.
