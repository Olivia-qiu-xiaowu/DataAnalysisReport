# Logistic Regressions and Multiple Linear Regression Model
To observe whether the trend of PMI decline or increase is influenced by industrial principal components, actual EPMI, and measured PMI trends, a model was built to analyze data over a period of 70 months from January 1 2018 to December 1 2023.

## Process
1. Calculate the trend of each variable and assign values: 1 for increase, -1 for decrease, and 0 for no change.
2. Compare with the PMI trend, use Excel to calculate accuracy.
3. Since EPMI has many sub-items, there will focuses on the impact rate of EMPI.

## Result
Individually:<br/>
  The industrial principal component's accuracy is 51.7% over five years, 52.8% over the three years, 66.72% over one year, and 80% over the past ten months.<br/>
  The actual EPMI accuracy is 63.3% over five years, 72.2% over three years, 66.7% over one year, and 70% over the past ten months.<br/>
  The measured PMI accuracy is 56.7% over five years, 63.9% over three years, 58.3% over one year, and 60% over the past ten monnths.
